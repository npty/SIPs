<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your SIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

List Axelar Token (AXL) on Synthetix Perps.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This is a proposal to list Axelar Token (AXL) perpetual on Synthetix Perps.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

Axelar delivers secure cross-chain communication for Web3. Our infrastructure enables dApp users to interact with any asset or application, on any chain, with one click. Axelar recently got listed on Upbit spot market and Bybit Futures which is an opportunity to expand offering on Synthetix Perps.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

Axelar is the fastest-growing interoperability solution based on data from Binance Research. Axelar facilitates advanced cross-chain communication between Cosmos and EVM ecosystems via its General Message Passing (“GMP”) feature, a key driver of network activity. Notably, Axelar connects to 53 chains, showcasing extensive network support, and uses quadratic voting and key rotation to improve security.

Axelar has partnered with leading DeFi applications such as dYdX and Lido. RWA issuers such as Ondo Finance leverage Axelar’s message passing for Ondo bridge, fostering a unified on-chain USDY liquidity. Axelar is also not short on enterprise partnerships, evidenced by its recent collaboration with Microsoft, marking Axelar’s entry into the Azure Marketplace. This partnership makes tools like AxelarJS SDK and GMP available to developers, offering advanced hybrid blockchain solutions. Given the extensive use of Azure worldwide, this partnership could significantly fuel Axelar’s growth and expansion.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

The perps market will require Pyth price feed oracle to be deployed on OP Mainnet.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

N/A

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
